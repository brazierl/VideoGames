Demonstration project using Ember.js. 

## Objective
This project aims to demonstrate some basic skills using web technologies and especially Ember.js framework.

## Resources
This application was built using the Ember.js website (https://emberjs.com/) and relies on a remote API to retrieve data (https://igdb.github.io/api/about/welcome/).

## Architecture
### Backend
The backend is implemented using Node.js which is used as a proxy to retreive data from the remote API.
### Frontend
The frontend is developped using Ember.js, an open-source Javascript web framework with an MVC architecture. 
Ember use follows the Convention over Configuration principle to simplify implementations.
